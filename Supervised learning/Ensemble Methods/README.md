# Header 1 Ensemble Learning Methods in Machine Learning
Ensemble learning is a powerful technique in machine learning where multiple models are combined to improve the overall performance and robustness of the system. This repository provides an overview of ensemble learning methods and their implementation using Python and scikit-learn.

# Header 2 Introduction
Ensemble learning leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" principle, where combining multiple weak learners can often yield a stronger learner. It helps reduce overfitting, improve generalization, and enhance prediction accuracy compared to individual models.

1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
Bagging involves training multiple base models independently on random subsets of the training data (with replacement) and then aggregating their predictions, usually by averaging for regression or voting for classification. Bagging helps reduce variance and improve stability.

2. Boosting
Boosting algorithms build a sequence of weak learners iteratively, with each subsequent model focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. Common boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Boosting aims to reduce bias and improve overall performance.

3. Voting
Voting methods combine predictions from multiple base models by taking a majority vote (hard voting) or averaging the predicted probabilities (soft voting). It's effective when individual models have different strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to complement each other.

4. Stacking
Stacking, also known as stacked generalization, involves training multiple base models and then using a meta-learner (higher-level model) to combine their predictions. The meta-learner learns to weigh the predictions of base models based on their performance on a validation set.
